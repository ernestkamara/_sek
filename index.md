Android | Kotlin | Flutter | Scrum Master certified | IoT enthusiast | 🇸🇱🇳🇴👪🏿

As a Senior Software Engineer at Skyscanner, I lead and mentor the Android team in the Origami squad, which aims to create a seamless and personalized travel experience for millions of users worldwide. With over 10 years of experience in mobile development, I have a deep understanding of the Android ecosystem and the best practices for delivering high-quality code and user interfaces.

I am also a certified Professional Scrum Master, which enables me to apply agile principles and methodologies to our team's workflow and collaboration. I enjoy working with talented and diverse colleagues, sharing knowledge and feedback, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and solving complex problems that positively impact people's lives.
